This is a web game called Dr. Mike. It's set up like Dr. Mario from the NES
except the viruses regenerate. I've been testing it mostly in Chromium, but
it seems to work alright in Firefox and IE9. It uses canvas elements, so
older browsers shouldn't work.

Hopefully we'll hook up a website for this in a few days, but for now it can
be played using the html preview:
