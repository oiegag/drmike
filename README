This is a web game called Dr. Mike. It's set up like Dr. Mario from the NES
except the viruses regenerate. I've been testing it mostly in Chromium, but
it seems to work alright in Firefox and IE9. It uses canvas elements, so
older browsers shouldn't work.

To play it online, go to http://compositiongames.com/drmike/
To play it locally, download the source, unzip it (if you're in Win 7, that
means you have to copy the folder out of the zip folder), and open index.html in your browser.
