Dr. Mike

Dr. Mike is a tribute to the classic NES game, Dr. Mario, with virus regeneration every few turns. Virus growth tends to make you have to play in a different style than
Dr. Mario. Try building walls around viruses and setting traps for them to grow into so that you can get the upper hand.
